The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must find the count of
alphabets M which are present between the alphabets a and m (inclusive) in the string S. Then
the program must find the count of alphabets N which are present between the
alphabets n and z (inclusive) in the string S. Finally, the program must print the output based on
the following conditions.
-If M is greater than N then print FIRSTHALF.
-If N is greater than M then print SECONDHALF.
-If M and N are equal then print -1.
Note: The alphabets in S are only in lower case.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.
Output Format:
The first line contains FIRSTHALF or SECONDHALF or -1.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcdxyz
Output:
FIRSTHALF
Explanation:
The alphabets a, b, c and d are present between the alphabets a and m. So their count M is 4.
The alphabets x, y and z are present between the alphabets n and z. So their count N is 3.
Here M is greater than N. So FIRSTHALF is printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
zyasnw
Output:
SECONDHALF
